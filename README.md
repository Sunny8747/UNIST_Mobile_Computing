Studied at UNIST Mobile Computing

## 1. Contents

- Context awareness
- Sensors
- Energy efficiency
- Wireless sensing
- Localization
- Backscatter communication
- Mobile machine learning (Basic concepts)

## 2. Assignments (Android app)

### 1) Users's moving patterns awareness

- The Application aware walking, running, upstairs, downstairs, sitting, standup.
- My Tensorflow_Lite skill was bad so I used Data analysis configuration for high accuracy.

### 2) Localization

- Localization at univ building
- I used magnetic sensor for get orientation.
- Assignment2 Description : <https://github.com/Sunny8747/UNIST_Mobile_Computing/blob/master/Assignment2/CSE465%20Project2.pdf>
- Problem : <https://github.com/Sunny8747/UNIST_Mobile_Computing/blob/master/Assignment2/Assign2_mini_20131329%EC%8B%A0%EC%84%A0%EC%9A%B0.pdf>
- Result video : In repository

### 3) Free project (Location detecting + Motion awareness + Alarm + Run application in background)

- In our UNIV all attendance checks are done by mobile app.
- So, frequently forgot checking attendance.
- 1. Location detecting : detecting classroom.(if user is at dormitory, the app will not work)
- 2. If user is running, alarming 1min later
- 3. The app is on -> run attendance application (alarm program is background state -> save energy)
